## 📝 Question: Reverse the String Without Reversing Special Characters

**Problem:**  
Write a function `reverseString(str)` that reverses only the **alphabetic characters** in a string while keeping all **special characters** (non-alphabetic) in their original positions.

**Example:**

```javascript
Input:  "a,b$c"
Output: "c,b$a"

Explanation:
- The alphabets are: 'a', 'b', 'c'
- Reverse them: 'c', 'b', 'a'
- Place them back in original positions, keeping ',' and '$' unchanged.
```
